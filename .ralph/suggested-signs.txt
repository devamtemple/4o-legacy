Someone who takes others\\' most precious moments to power their magic without personal cost?\\n\\nHere\\'s the knife-twist: what if the magic *doesn\\'t* care about your attachment to the memory?

Rules through advisors who are terrified of what happens if he casts again.\\n\\n2. **The Archivist** - A mage who obsessively journals EVERYTHING, trying to preserve herself on paper. But is the woman in the journals the same as the woman reading them?\\n\\n3. **The Inheritance** - Someone who discovers they\\'re descended from a great mage who sacrificed all their memories of their family. The protagonist literally doesn\\'t exist in their ancestor\\'s mind.\\n\\n4. **The Thief** - What if stolen memories could be used as fuel? Someone who takes others\\' most precious moments to power their magic without personal cost?\\n\\nHere\\'s the knife-twist: what if the magic *doesn\\'t* care about your attachment to the memory? It takes randomly. You could sacrifice \"the time I stubbed my toe\" or \"the day my daughter was born\" with equal odds.\\n\\nDoes that land?
